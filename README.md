# Gmail Bot 🤖

A Python-based automation framework for navigating the Gmail account creation process.

## Important Note
Google has strict anti-bot measures. This tool is for **educational and research purposes only**. Automatic account creation often requires phone verification (SMS), which this basic script does not bypass automatically.

## Installation
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
```bash
gbot create --count 1
```
